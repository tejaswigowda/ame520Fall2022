# Assignment 3 -- OptiTrack MOCAP assignment

## Due September 24th before class. 

## Task

- Please email Tejaswi Gowda (tejaswi@asu.edu) your ASU ID. We will get you access to the MOCAP space.

- For your first exercise with optitrack; create a mocap recording, 1-2 minutes long, in a bvh file (https://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/cs-838-1999/Jeff/BVH.html) as a deliverable for this assignment. We will be learning how to integrate bvh into 3D environments in the next couple of classes.

Consider the 1-2 mins of movement you are going to capture carefully; its qualities e.g., tempo, range, in space, weight, volume, etc] and other physical properties. As well, consider its function; reaching, running, turning [to see something/someone?] architecture for something /someone else? These are different kinds of questions that may or may not be linked to a meaning you are looking to convey in your final project. 
Please:
Write down your movement ‘score’ [descriptive text and/or image is fine] for 1 -2 mins, including your considerations of above
Create the capture recording in the Optitrack system
Reflect on what  you have made, and revise your score accordingly.

With this process, you all will begin to create a movement data recording you plan to use in your final project. 

Keep in mind this is a ‘live’ score, so you may revise your score and capture it to fit the needs of your project as you develop your ideas.

For the purposes of this assignment, you need only do a single capture and two scores [original and revised version 1.

Have fun!
