# Assignment 1

## Due September 1st before class. 

## Task

Create a private github repository called `AME520Fall2022` and add 
`tejaswigowda`/`movementundercommons21` as
a collaborator. The repository should contain a `README.md` that has the
following information:

1. Your full name
2. Your ASU ID.

You will submit assignments using this repository. 

Now for the core of this assignment:

Please watch this video (https://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_wolpert_the_real_reason_for_brains) and answer the following questions:

1. Based on DW's talk; discuss how you think learning about movement might help to inform your approach to designing systems?
2. Since this talk was aired in 2011, beyond Baysian inference, what other techniques have been applied to these issues?
~~Why is Baysian inference applicable modeling how the brain performs movement?
2. What do you think about the evolutionary adaptation of the "best" (optimal) movement we all share?
3. Please share your thoughts on the concept of "noise" the presenter discussed. How do you think the brain resolves this noise?
4. Can you think of any modeling framework/technology that could perform better than Baysian modeling?
5. Do you think lack of movement (think "metaverse") lead us to digest our brains?~~
6. 

Next read this text: https://github.com/tejaswigowda/ame520Fall2022/blob/main/READINGS/Dourish%20excerpt%20chap1'HistoryofInteraction.pdf

Answer these questions:
1. Why is understanding the history of interaction important for current designers?
2. How will understanding interaction help us navigate emerging technologies -- AR, XR etc.
3. Can you summarize the history of Human Computer Interaction from this paper (in 2 paragraphs)


Please read this text: https://github.com/tejaswigowda/ame520Fall2022/blob/main/READINGS/HCI_Design_Somatics_WITHCOMMENTS_p54-loke-schiphorst-thesomaticturninhuman-computerinteraction.pdf


Can you please answer these:
1. What does somatics have to offer to the field of HCI?
2. What are the 4 somatic values?
3. How can somatic studies be applied to your current field of study/research?
